Priority Queues 
/*This data structure containing records with numerical keys(priorites)  and supporting some of the following operations: */

Construct a priority queue from N given items; 
insert a new item; 
remove  the largest item; 
replace the largest item with a new item (unless the new item is larger); 
change the priority of an item; 
Delete an arbitrary specified item; 
Join two priority queues into one larger one; 

(if records can have duplicate keys, we take the largest to mean any record with the largest key value)
