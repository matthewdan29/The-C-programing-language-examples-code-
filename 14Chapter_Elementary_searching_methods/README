As with proirity queues, it is best to think of search algorithms as 
belonging to packages implementing a veriety of gneric operations that can be 
separated from particular implementations, so that alternate implementations canbe substituted easily. The operations of intrest include: 	

	Initialize the data structure. 
	Search for a record (or records) having a given key. 
	insert a new record.
	delete a specified record
	Join two dictionaries to make a large one. 
	Sort the dictionary; output all the records in sorted order. 

As with priority queues, it is sometimes convenient to combine some of these operations.
