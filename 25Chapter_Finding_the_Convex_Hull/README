It may be clear that computing the convex hull is closely reated to sorting. in fact, a convex hull algorithm can be used to sort, in the following way. Given 'N' numbers to sort, turn them into points (in polar coordinates) by treating numbers as angles (suitably normalized) with a fixed radius for each point. The convex hull of this point set is an "N-gon" containing all of the points. Since the output must be ordered in the order in which the points appear on this polygon, it can be used to find the sorted order of the original values (remember that the input was unordered). this is not a formal proof that computing  the convex hull is no easier than sorting, because, for example, the cost of a trigonmometric functions required to convert the numbers into points on the polygon must be considered.
