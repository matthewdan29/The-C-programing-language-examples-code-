The Rules of safe random number generating was Develped by the Scientist 
		Dr. Donald Ervin Knuth from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
 
His contubition below provided building block for all technolgy today 
	Choosing the constants "seed", "b", and "m". Some common-sense principles apply, but in this case common sense isn't enought to ensure good random numbers. 
	First, 'm' should be large
	It will normally be convenient to make 'm' a power of 10 or 2. 
	Second, 'b' shouldn't be too large or too small (1 digit less then m)
	Third, 'b' should be end with x21, with 'x' even
	 

I understand most poeple used the random module for python or any OOP lang but random and generating truely random numbers is important to creating programs in AI and encyption.

The best-known method for generating random numbers, which has been used almost exclusively since it was introduced by D. Lehmer in 1951, is the so-called "linear congruential method". If "seed" contains some arbitrary number, then the following statement fills up an array with 'N' random numbers using this method: 
	a[0] = seed; 
	for (i = 1; i <= N; i++)
		a[i] = (a[i-1] * b+t) % m; /* remeber the modular functions provides the r or remainder of int/int != R (notations for whole number also rational ) */


(hey use a random number with a prime int that then is modular for right triangles while decresing by a constent. )
