Dr. Kenneth Edward Batcher from U of Illinois invented in 1968 the method "Odd-evan Merge".

The essential feature of the method is that all of the compare-exchange operations in each stage can be done in parallel. As property states, it is significant because it clearly demonstrates that two files of 'N' elements can be merged together in "log N" parallel steps, using fewer than "N log N" compare-exchange boxes. From the description, this might seem like a straghtforward result; actually, the problem of finding such a machine had stumped researcher for quite some time. (think of computers that can to multi threading sorting for large list of items that can be aranged from smallest Nth item to largest N-1 item).
