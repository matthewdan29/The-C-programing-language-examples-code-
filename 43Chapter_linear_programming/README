A two-phase process is normally used to solve general linear programs. 
First, solve a linear program involving the artificaial 's' variables in order to get a point on the simplex for our original problem. 
Then, we dispose of the 's' variables and reintroduce our original objective function to proceed from this point to the solution.

Look at frameworks like TenserFlow (GPU processing) and pandas server (lots of tools to use in one server application. )
