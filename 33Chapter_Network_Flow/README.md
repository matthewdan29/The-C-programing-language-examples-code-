This explains why Network flow is important to oil but also AI. DFS plays a big roll.

Consider the idealized drawing of a small network of oil pips. The pipes are fixed capacity proportional to thier size and oil can flow only downhill. Futhermore, swithces at each junction control how much oil goes in each direction. No matter how the swithces are set, the system reaches a state of equilibrium when the amount of oil flowing into the system on the top is equal to the amount flowing out at the bottom and when the amount of oil flowing in at each junchtion is equal to the amount of oil flowing out. We measure both flow and pipe capacity in terms of integral units (gallons per second, ect).

also you can think of a program that injects a instructions to set the model that the engery flow is using to -1 or some unequal number. This could case a false alarm or alarm not to be signaled.

Our challenge is to develop an algorithm that can find "proper" switch settings for any network. Futhermore, we want to be assured that no other swithc setting will give a higher flow.
